view of the business—covering everything from the initial vendor purchase to the final retail sale.

📊 Business Problem Overview
In the retail and wholesale industry, maintaining high profitability depends on the synergy between inventory management and sales strategy. Inefficient operations often lead to sunk costs that erode margins. This analysis aims to solve core operational inefficiencies by addressing the following key areas:

1. Brand Performance & Pricing Optimization
Objective: Identify underperforming brands within the portfolio.

Detail: By analyzing sales velocity and margin data, we determine which brands are stagnating. This helps stakeholders decide where to implement strategic pricing adjustments or aggressive promotional campaigns to clear slow-moving stock.

2. Vendor Strategic Analysis
Objective: Determine top-tier vendors and investigate profitability variance.

Detail: Not all high-volume vendors are high-profit vendors. This analysis evaluates vendors based on their contribution to both gross profit and total sales volume to identify which partnerships are most valuable and which ones present a financial risk due to low margins.

3. Procurement & Cost Efficiency
Objective: Analyze the impact of bulk purchasing on unit costs.

Detail: We investigate the relationship between order quantity and cost per unit to validate if bulk buying actually yields the expected economies of scale, or if the discount is offset by other factors.

4. Inventory Turnover & Holding Costs
Objective: Assess inventory turnover rates to improve operational efficiency.

Detail: High inventory levels tie up capital and increase insurance and warehousing costs. By calculating turnover ratios, the project aims to minimize "dead stock" and optimize the cash conversion cycle.

5. Risk Mitigation (Vendor Dependency)
Objective: Evaluate the business's reliance on specific suppliers.

Detail: Over-reliance on a small group of vendors can lead to supply chain vulnerabilities. This analysis highlights concentration risks to encourage a more diversified and resilient vendor ecosystem.
